# Reflection

- I have maneged to achieve 🐿️ 1 however I am not quite sure on how to keep the data after refreshing the page. I have not acchieved 🐿️ 2 as i decided to make my own Json since ive been wanting to do that for a while now, i think i would have been able to do it if I was going for it. and as of 🐿️ 3, i have done a bit of styling however I was a bit silly as I tried to do a stresh goal first (that ended up being broken) which took a lit of time. If i had more time i would have been able to do it, or if i styled first.

However my biggest acchivement was actually being able to make a functional cookie clicker after my first attempt which was a pure mess

# User stories

🐿️ 1 - As a user, I want the application to save and retrieve my game data so that my progress is preserved even when I close and reopen the game.
🐿️ 2 - As a developer, I want the application to use an API to retrieve upgrade information so that users can access current upgrade details and seamlessly integrate them into their gameplay.
🐿️ 3 - As a user, I want the application to have excellent UI styling so that it is visually appealing and provides a pleasant and intuitive experience while playing the game.
